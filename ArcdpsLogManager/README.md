## Contributing

Reporting bugs is the most important way of contributing, it's hard to fix things you are
not aware about. Either create an issue on GitHub or let us know in the `#bug-reports`
channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rNXRS6ZkYe). Also feel free to request new features.

If you want to implement something new, it might be a good idea to ask first because some parts
of the codebase are not quite stable yet.
